  ## Description
 This is the Note Taker app. Upon loading the application, the user will be taken to a landing page with a button that says "Get Started". When the user clicks that button, they are taken to a second page where they are able to create notes that they would like to save. They will be asked to enter a Title and Text for the note. Once they begin typing out the text for their note, a "save disc" icon will appear in the upper right hand corner of the screen. When the user is finished typing their note, they can click that icon and the note will be saved in the left hand column.
 
 If the user would like to access one of their older notes, they just need to click on the note in the left hand column and that note will be displayed again in the right hand column. They are now able to edit that note as they see fit and then click the "save disc" icon once again to save their edits. 

 If an older note is displayed in the right hand column but the user would like to create a new note, they can click the "plus" icon in the upper right hand corner and they will be given a new note template to create a new note and can then save the note to the left hand column using the "disc" icon as before. 

If the user would like to delete one of their older notes, they will just need to click on the red "trash can" icon. This will remove that note from the left hand column.
